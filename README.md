        <b>Who am I?</b>
        <p>My name is Phutimet Punnotok, but most people call me Zen. I'm a male.
            I was born in Thailand, a country in Southeast Asia, often referred to as the "Land of Smiles." 
            I was born on the 29th of July, 2009.
            I'm a cheerful person. People say I smile a lot and that I'm kind of a fun guy. 
            I can speak several languages, including Thai, English, and Japanese.
            My favorite subjects are Mathematics, Computer Science, and English. 
            I love music. I don't just listen to it-I also play different kinds of instruments. 
            My favorites are the drums and guitar.
            I want to be a computer engineer when I grow up because I enjoy anything related to computers. 
            I hope to work in a field related to computers or programming.
            I also like arts, but, funny enough, I'm not good at either drawing or painting.

        <b>How did I discovered that I want to be a computer engineer?</b><br> 
        <p>
            I was doing well in computer studies at my school, and one day, my friends called me to help them with their work. 
            I quickly figured out the error in their code, and soon after, 
            I started teaching them about coding and programming. 
            It worked out well-my friends were able to pass more tests and even scored higher grades.
            This experience sparked my interest in programming, 
            and I decided that I want to become a computer engineer. 
            No matter what challenges come my way, I'll stay determined and work hard to achieve my goals.
